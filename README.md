•	Some of the hashses are (MD5)message Digest hashing algorithm and some of them are not found. 
•	It is very easy to use the aircrack-ng cracking tool and with the wordtxt possible passwords.txt file.

•	The hashes are given are in the MD5 hashing algorithm.It can crack instantly, by using  the aircrack-ng and  password are very weak it seems.that the user did not used any other upper case letters,numbers and symbols.
•	The  reference website (https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)to now know the password strength that I have used.

•	We should give the strong password suggestions,like using symbols and numbers,when user is creating.
•	We should give the conditions to the user while creating the password.That  password should contain lower case,upper case, numbers and symbols.
•	The minimum length of the password should more than 6 to 10 letters.

•	And we should use the hashing algorithms like SHA-512,Whirlpool and RIPEMD-320 etc.
•	By this things that we can minimize the successful breach.


•	Avoid common words and character combinations in your password.
•	Longer passwords are better, 8 characters is a starting point.
•	Don’t reuse your passwords.
•	Include special character, Capital and Small letters, numbers in your password.
•	Don’t let users include their username, actual name, date of birth and other personal information while creating a password.
•	Train your users to follow these policies to keep their passwords safe.
